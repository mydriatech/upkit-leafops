# UPKIT `upkit_enprov_selfsigned` crate

This crate provides a dummy `EnrollmentProvider` implementation that generates
a self-signed certificate.

Useful for testing.

Don't use this in production unless you really want to avoid all the benefits of
Public Key Infrastructures and just keep some of the complexity. :)
